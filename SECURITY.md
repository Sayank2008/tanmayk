## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within our website, please follow the responsible disclosure process outlined below:

1. **Privately report the vulnerability to us:** Send an email to [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com) with a detailed description of the vulnerability. Include steps to reproduce the vulnerability, and any other relevant information.

2. **Allow time for remediation:** We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and will work to address the issue promptly. Please give us reasonable time to assess and mitigate the vulnerability.

3. **Public disclosure:** Once the vulnerability is resolved, and a new version is released, we will work together to coordinate an appropriate disclosure timeline.

## Supported Versions

- We commit to providing security updates for the latest stable release.
- Older releases may not receive security updates, and users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest version.

## Security Measures

### HTTPS

Our website enforces the use of HTTPS to ensure secure communication between the user's browser and our servers.

### Data Encryption

Sensitive data, such as user credentials and payment information, is stored and transmitted securely using industry-standard encryption algorithms.

### Authentication and Authorization

We employ secure authentication mechanisms and appropriate authorization controls to ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive functionalities.

### Regular Security Audits

We conduct regular security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities. These audits may include code reviews, penetration testing, and vulnerability scanning.

### Third-Party Libraries

We carefully vet and monitor third-party libraries and dependencies for known vulnerabilities. Regular updates are performed to mitigate any potential risks.

## Bug Bounty Program

We appreciate the efforts of security researchers in improving our security posture. We offer a bug bounty program as a token of our gratitude for responsibly disclosing vulnerabilities. Visit our [Bug Bounty Program](link-to-bug-bounty-program) page for more details.

## Changes to this Policy

We reserve the right to update and modify this security policy at any time. Changes will be documented in this file.
